  Invalid manifest format

  Component's name is not valid "espressif/espressif__esp-zigbee-lib", should
  contain only letters, numbers, /, _ and -.

  Component's name "espressif/espressif__esp-zigbee-lib" should not contain
  two consecutive underscores.



  SUGGESTION: This component may be using a newer version of the component
  manager.

  You can try to update the component manager by running:

      /home/studiopresent/.espressif/python_env/idf5.3_py3.12_env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade idf-component-manager
